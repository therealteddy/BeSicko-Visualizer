# VisualPhysics - Visualise Physics Concepts
I write this shit for fun! So no docs for ya brudda! 

## Dependencies 
- Love2D 0.80+ 

## Want this for yourself? 
Grab the release or interpret the projects using the love-interpreter

# NOTE
This project is far from a physics simulator! Although, I would like to write one. 

This collection of programs here is merely to help high schoolers visualize and (maybe) analyze the concepts!
